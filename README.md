# Text-to-Image
A Machine Learning based project that synthesizes images based on text input which describe the features of image.
It is achieved through text and image processing and training the GAN models.
The datasets can be downloaded from following links:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3y_msrWZaXLT1BZdVdycDY5TEE — Download the birds.zip file and extract it inside the root directory.
Download the CUB dataset using the command, or directory from the link and extract it inside the root directory —
wget http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200-2011/CUB_200_2011.tgz
Here StackGAN is used due to its advantage- StackGAN decomposes the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. 
Environmoent used to implement- Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colaboratory.
Tensorflow version - 1
